## 3.1 Introduction to Vector Search

In the evolving landscape of data management, vector databases have emerged as a critical solution for handling vast and diverse datasets. Unlike traditional databases, which are limited to structured data, vector databases excel in managing unstructured data and providing relevant results based on context.
